This is a web app which classifies my five favorite characters from the Harry Potter series!  
It establishes a collection of target classes(features) and the model is trained to recognize them using examples with labels.

The structure of the folders are:
    
    *UI: Front-end code for the website    
    *Model:Contains python notebook for model-building    
    *Server: Python flask server
    *images_dataset: Dataset used in the model training
